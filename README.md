Watch Tower is a Computational Geometry problem in which we are suposed to find the min number of towers we need to cover a terrain.
In this code, you can specify the points (in the input.txt) to draw the terrain, and also the location of the tower in (x,y) format, and its length, and the code shows you wich parts of the terrain are visible (green parts), and which parts are not.
